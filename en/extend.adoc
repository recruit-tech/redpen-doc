== Extending RedPen

We can make RedPen extensions with Java and JavaScript. In the following sections, we learn the way to make the extensions.

[[extending-with-java]]
=== Extending RedPen with Java

RedPen users can extend RedPen by creating new Validators. This section
describes how we construct Validators and covers the basics of the
internal document model used by Validators.

RedPen users can create new validators for themselves or their
organization. Adding validator is simple - just write a class which
extends the abstract class **Validator**.

[[extending-validators]]
==== Extending Validators

There are several methods which users can implement for their methods
(validate, prevalidate and init).

[[validate-methods]]
==== validate methods

Minimally, we just need to implement the "validate" template method.

Users need to implement the one of validate methods provided by the
Validator class. Currently there are three validate methods with three
different parameters.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * validate the input document and returns the invalid points.
 * {@link cc.redpen.validator.Validator} provides empty implementation. Validator implementation validates documents can override this method.
 *
 * @param document input
 */
 public void validate(Document document)

 /**
  * validate the input document and returns the invalid points.
  * {@link cc.redpen.validator.Validator} provides empty implementation. Validator implementation validates sentences can override this method.
  *
  * @param sentence input
  */
  public void validate(Sentence sentence)

 /**
  * validate the input document and returns the invalid points.
  * {@link cc.redpen.validator.Validator} provides empty implementation. Validator implementation validates sections can override this method.
  *
  * @param section input
  */
  public void validate(Section section)
----

NOTE: The implemented class needs to be in one of the packages: 'cc.redpen.validator', 'cc.redpen.validator.sentence' or 'cc.redpen.validator.section.'

[[prevalidate-method]]
==== prevalidate method

The preValidate method called before validate method is run. This method
is useful to create the prerequisite to run validate method. There are
two prevalidte methods variations which have different parameters.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Process input blocks before run validation. This method is used to store
 * the information needed to run Validator before the validation process.
 *
 * @param sentence input sentence
 */
 public void preValidate(Sentence sentence)

 /**
  * Process input blocks before run validation. This method is used to store
  * the information needed to run Validator before the validation process.
  *
  * @param section input section
  */
  public void preValidate(Section section)
----

[[conf-properties]]
[suppress='WeakExpression SymbolWithSpace']
==== Configuration properties

If validator needs Configuration properties, validator constructor can be used to define them.
This way RedPen will understand that your validator supports these properties and various plugins can show them in a GUI.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * @param keyValues String key and Object value pairs for supported config properties.
 */
public Validator(Object...keyValues)
----

For example, *SentencelengthValidator* has a configuration property **max_len**,
which to specifies the maximum length of sentences in input documents.
Following configuration specifies the maximum length to 200.

[source,xml]
----
<redpen-conf>
    <validators>
        ...
        <validator name="SentenceLength">
            <property name="max_len" value="200"/>
        </validator>
        ...
    </validators>
</redpen-conf>
----

SentenceLengthValidator loads the value of max_len automatically if it is defined in validator's constructor.
If max_len is missing from the config, the value is left as default.

[source,java]
----

public SentenceLengthValidator() {
  super("max_len", 30); // Default maximum length of sentences.
}

----

Later configuration value can be accessed via `getInt("max_len")` or similar methods.

In case you need to process config properties before they can be used in `validate()` method, you can override the `init()` method.

[[adding-validators]]
[suppress='WeakExpression']
==== Adding Validators

There are two ways to add your Validator to RedPen.

One of the way is to add the Validator source file to the RedPen source tree
and then build RedPen normally. This method is simple, but involves
bundling the source code for the Validators with the source code for
RedPen.

The second way is to create a Validator plugin. Creating a plugin has
the advantage that you can then independently manage the source code for
your Validator.

Note that in both cases, your Validator's class name must have the
suffix **Validator**.

In the next section, we will first explain the way to add a new Validator to
Redpen's source tree. Then we weil go thourgh the way to construct a Validator plugin.

[[add-a-validator-in-redpen-source]]
==== Add a Validator to RedPen source

Let's define a plain Validator (SentenceLengthValidator) which check
if the input sentence is over 100 characters long. Then we will apply it to RedPen's source tree.

[[sentencelengthvalidator]]
===== SentenceLengthValidator

We create a PlainSentenceLengthValidator class and specify the package
**cc.redpen.validator.sentence**. Therefore the class is stored in the
**redpen/redpen-core/src/main/java/cc/redpen/validator/sentence/** directory.

The following is an implementation of this class.

[source,java]
----
package cc.redpen.validator.sentence;

/**
 * Validate input sentences contain more characters more than specified.
 */
public class PlainSentenceLengthValidator extends Validator {

  /**
   * Default constructor initializes properties with their default values.
   */
  public PlainSentenceLengthValidator() {
    super("max_len", 30); // Default maximum length of sentences.
  }

  @Override
  public void validate(Sentence sentence) {
    if (sentence.getContent().length() > getInt("max_len")) {
      addValidationError(sentence, sentence.getContent().length(), maxLength);
    }
  }
}
----

The class has a validate method which takes a Sentence object as its
parameter. When this class is registered in the configuration file,
RedPen automatically applies the method to each sentence in the input document.

[[include-a-new-validator]]
===== Register a new Validator to configuration file

To register your Validator in the RedPen configuration, add the
Validator's name removing the **Validator** suffix, to a configuration file.

For example, to activate our newly created Validator PlainSentenceLengthValidator,
include the validator element as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<redpen-conf>
    <validator>
        ...
        <validator name="PlainSentenceLength" />
        ...
    </validator>
</redpen-conf>
----

We would then run RedPen normally, using this configuration file.

[[create-a-validator-plugin]]
[suppress='ParagraphNumber']
==== Create a Validator plugin

When creating a Validator plugin, it is often easier to start by using
another plugin's project as a template.

As an example, I have written a simple Validator plugin
https://github.com/takahi-i/hankaku-kana-validator[hankaku_kana_validator].

The most significant file for the plugin is `pom.xml` which exists at the
top of the project. This file is the Maven configuration file, which is
a popular software project management tool for Java.

The following is the content of `pom.xml`:

[source,java]
----
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>redpen.cc</groupId>
    <artifactId>hankaku-kana-validator</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <name>hankaku-kana-validator</name>
    <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>
    <dependencies>
         <dependency>
             <groupId>redpen.cc</groupId>
             <artifactId>redpen-core</artifactId>
             <version>1.2</version>
             <scope>system</scope>
             <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/redpen-core-0.6.jar</systemPath>
         </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
----

Usually you do not need to change the `pom.xml` file, except for the
contents of the *artifact-id* and *name* elements. You should alter the
name to fit the function of your Validator.

After changing `pom.xml`, you should delete the existing validator
file (`HankakuKanaValidator.java`) from "main/java/cc/redpen/validator/sentence."
Then, put your Validator's source file in "main/java/cc/redpen/validator/sentence" or
"main/java/cc/redpen/validator/section."

Once you have included your Validator implementation, you can build the plugin.

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn install
----

[[including-a-user-defined-validator-plugin]]
[suppress='SentenceLength']
===== Including a user-defined Validator plugin

When you have successfully built your Validator plugin,
you can use the validator plugin in RedPen.
To deply the plugin, copy the plugin's jar file from the *target* directory to a
directory in the classpath, such as the library directory ($REDPEN_HOME/lib).
Once copied, you can add your Validator to the configuration file as described above. Remember to remove the
*Validator* suffix from the name you enter in redpen-config.xml.

[[extending-with-javascript]]
[suppress='WeakExpression']
=== Extending RedPen in JavaScript
For those who are unfamiliar with Java, RedPen version 1.3 introduced JavaScriptValidator, which is a special validator that loads Validator implementations written in JavaScript.

[[enable-javascript]]
[suppress='SymbolWithSpace']
==== Enabling JavaScriptValidator
To enable JavaScriptValidator, simply add `<validator name="JavaScript"/>` in your `redpen-conf.xml` as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<redpen-conf lang="en">
  <validators>
       ...snip...
    <validator name="JavaScript" />
  </validators>
</redpen-conf>
----

[[javascript-validator]]
==== Write your own validator in JavaScript
JavaScriptValidator will load all files with `.js` suffix from `$REDPEN_HOME/js` directory. This location can be overridden with `script-path` property of JavaScriptValidator. You can set multiple 'script-path' property.

[source,javascript]
----
<redpen-conf lang="en">
  <validators>
       ...snip...
     <validator name="JavaScript" >
       <property name="script-path" value="/path/to/your/validator/directory-a" />
     </validator>
     <validator name="JavaScript" >
       <property name="script-path" value="/path/to/your/validator/directory-b" />
     </validator>
  </validators>
</redpen-conf>
----


Functions with the following signature will be called upon validation time:
[source,javascript]
----
function preValidateSentence(sentence) {
}

function preValidateSection(section) {
}

function validateDocument(document) {
  // your validation logic for document here
}

function validateSentence(sentence) {
  // if(your validation logic for sentence here) {
  //   addError('validation error message', sentence);
  // }
}

function validateSection(section) {
  // your validation logic for section here
}
----

[[javascript-example]]
[suppress='SuccessiveWord SymbolWithSpace WeakExpression']
==== Example
Here is a JavaScript version of NumberOfCharacterValidator:

[source,javascript]
----
var MIN_LENGTH = 100;
var MAX_LENGTH = 1000;

function validateSentence(sentence) {
  if (sentence.getContent().length() < MIN_LENGTH) {
    addError("Sentence is shorter than "
      + MIN_LENGTH + " characters long.", sentence);
  }
  if (sentence.getContent().length() > MAX_LENGTH) {
    addError("Sentence is longer than " + MAX_LENGTH
      + " characters long.", sentence);
  }
}
----

The code looks pretty much similar to the Java version.
The main difference is that the callback method `validate(Sentence sentence)` is referred as `validateSentence(sentence)` in the JavaScript version.

[[javascript-run]]
==== Run
Of course, it is JavaScript and there is no need to compile your validator.
Actually your JavaScript code will be compiled into Java byte-code by Nashorn, and it runs fast than you expect.
JavaScriptValidator will pick any *.js file located in `$REDPEN_HOME/js` directory.
You can simply run the redpen command to get your file validated by the js validator.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./bin/redpen -c myredpen-conf.xml 2be-validated.txt
2be-validated.txt:1: ValidationError[JavaScript], [NumberOfCharacter.js] Sentence is shorter than 100 characters long. at line: very short sentence.
----

[[javascript-property]]
==== Properties of JavaScript based extensions

We can spcify properties to JavaScript based validators. Adding properties, we can change the behaviors of the validators.
Users specify the properties to the configuration block for the JavaScript validator.
The following example specify the value of property, **max_char_num** to 5.

----
<validator name="JavaScript">
  <property name="max_char_num" value="5" />
</validator>
----

Specified properties in JavaScript configuration block are available in JavaScript extensions. For example, the following extension get the value of the property, **max_char_num** with getInt method.

----
function validateSentence(sentence) {
  var content = sentence.getContent().split(" ");
  var limit= getInt("max_char_num");

  for(var i = 0; i<content.length;i++){
    if(content[i].length >= limit){
      addError("word [" + content[i] +"] is too long. length: " + content[i].length, sentence);
    }
  }
}
----

RedPen provides methods for getting values of the properties for various types
The following table shows the list of provided get methods.

[options="header"]
|====
|Method name        |Type
|``getInt``         |Int
|``getFloat``       |Float
|``getString``      |String
|``getBoolean``     |Boolean
|``getSet``         |Set
|====

[[model-structure]]
[suppress='WeakExpression']
=== Model Structure

This section describes the internal document model structure generated
by parser objects.

Generated RedPen documents consist of several blocks, which represent
the elements of a document.

* *DocumentCollection* represents a set of one or more files that
contain a Document.
* *Document* represents a single file which contains one or more
Sections.
* *Section* contains several blocks (Header, Paragraph, ListBlock).
Except for Header, each Section can contain multiple blocks. A Section
may also specify the section level and its subsections.
* *Header* represents header sentences that contain a list of Sentence
objects.
* *Paragraph* contains one or more sentences.
* *ListBlock* contains a set of ListElement objects.

The following image shows the document model used by RedPen.
